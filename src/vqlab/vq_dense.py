"""Dense VQ modules — VQLinear and VQEmbedding.

WHY THESE EXIST. vq_switch.VQSwitchLinear is EXPERT-shaped: its __call__
takes routing indices and its kernels index a leading expert axis. A dense
model (gemma-4-e4b) has neither, so shipping a VQ e4b needs drop-ins for
plain nn.Linear and nn.Embedding.

THE EMBEDDING IS THE GOOD CASE. A [262144, 10752] table is 35.5% of e4b's
bytes, and an embedding lookup only ever needs the ROWS a batch touches —
so VQEmbedding gathers those code rows and decodes just those, never
materialising the table. Memory saving with no throughput cost.

THE LINEAR IS THE HONEST CASE. A matmul needs the whole weight, so
VQLinear decodes W per call: codebook[codes] -> [OUT, NSUB, D] ->
[OUT, IN], scaled group-wise. That trades compute for resident memory and
will be SLOWER than an 8-bit matmul; measure before believing any speed
claim. Correctness first — a fused dense kernel is a later optimisation,
and per E62 the fused work has to reproduce the scored numbers exactly
before it may replace this path.

Both mirror the fitter's contract exactly: scales are fp16 max-abs per
group of G along `in`, codes index a [K, D] fp16 codebook.

# Rows below which the fused kernel beats decode-the-weight-then-GEMM.
#
# This is TWO numbers, because the decode path's cost depends entirely on
# whether the codes are packed. Measured 2026-09-01 on the 27B mlp shape
# (OUT 17408, IN 5120, d=2), ms per call:
#
#   packed (K512/bits9)   N      1     8    32    68   128   256
#                         fused  0.6   1.4   4.2   8.3  14.9  29.2
#                         decode 9.6   9.5   9.7  10.2  10.2  11.3   -> cross ~100
#
#   unpacked (K256)       N      1     8    16    32    68    96
#                         fused  0.5   1.2   2.2   3.9   7.9  11.1
#                         decode 1.7   1.5   1.7   1.7   2.3   2.3   -> cross ~12
#
# Packed decode is ~9.5 ms flat because _unpack_rows dominates it; unpacked
# decode is 1.65 ms flat. So the fused path stays ahead six times longer when
# codes are packed.
#
# Allocation CHURN is the other reason -- though NOT the emergency it first
# looked like, and the correction is worth keeping. The decode path allocates
# and frees a ~170 MB fp16 weight per VQ linear, so mx.get_peak_memory(),
# which is a cumulative high-water counter of transient allocations, reads
# 37.9 GiB at 2048 context on a 14.6 GiB model. That is not resident memory:
# the same run completes under a 22 GiB mx.set_memory_limit cap, and process
# RSS stays at 15.2 GiB (12.2 / 14.2 / 15.2 for the 3.9 / 4.5 / 4.8 rungs,
# i.e. each runs in its own size).
#
# So the fused path wins here on speed and churn, not on survival. Never
# quote get_peak_memory() as a RAM requirement -- measure RSS. Doing the
# former produced a false alarm that briefly went into a public model card.

# THE PACKED CUTOFF IS GEOMETRY-DEPENDENT, and 96 was a d=2 number.
#
# The table above was measured on the 27B **d=2** mlp shape (K512/bits9,
# i.e. the 4.8bpw rung). The 3.9bpw rung is d=4/K=4096/packed-12 and got a
# dense kernel only later, so it inherited a cutoff nothing had measured for
# it -- and at d=4 the fused kernel does 4 codes per step against a 64 KB
# DEVICE codebook, which is a different cost curve entirely.
#
# Re-measured per rung with BOTH current paths (scripts/bench_dense_crossover.py,
# real L20 gate_proj, ms/call min, fused/decode ratio):
#
#     N            32     64     96    128
#     3.9 (d4)    0.90   1.62   2.27   2.85    crossover ~35
#     4.8 (d2p9)  0.45   0.87   1.20   1.61    crossover ~72
#     4.5 (d2)    1.47   2.77   3.46   4.31    crossover ~20
#
# So at d=4 the shipped 96 ran the fused kernel 2.27x SLOWER than decoding
# the weight over the whole band N=36..96; at d=2 packed it was mildly high;
# and the unpacked default of 12 is conservative but safe (crossover ~20).
#
# Keyed on d, because that is what the measurement says the curve depends
# on. VQ_DENSE_FUSED_MAX_N still overrides, and still wins, for A/B.
#
# NOTE ON NUMERICS. The fused and decode paths are NOT bit-identical to each
# other and never were (the fused kernel keeps an fp32 accumulator per scale
# group; the decode path materialises fp16 weights and hands them to the
# GEMM) -- only fused-vs-fused and decode-vs-decode identity is claimed
# anywhere. Lowering the cutoff therefore moves the N=36..96 band from the
# fused path onto the DECODE path, which is the path every published score
# for these artifacts was produced on. The change moves those shapes toward

    against vq_pack.unpack bit-exactly before first use.

    MEMORY (2026-09-01). This is called on the PREFILL path, once per VQ
    linear, and mlx builds the whole forward before evaluating it -- so every
    layer's temporaries are alive at once and this function sets the peak.
    The original cast the slab to uint64 (8 bytes per element) and returned
    uint32, which cost ~630 MB of transient per 27B mlp layer against the
    unpacked path's 178 MB. Across 64 layers that is the difference between a
    15.9 GB peak and a 30.0 GB one: the 4.8bpw artifact needed twice its own
    weight in RAM, which defeats the entire point of packing and can OOM a
    machine the model card says it fits on.

    Two changes, both bit-preserving:
      - stay in uint32. bits <= 16 always, so a field either lies inside one
        word or straddles two, and both cases are exact in 32-bit as long as
        the shift that would be >= 32 is never evaluated (see below).
      - return the narrowest dtype the codebook needs, not always uint32.

    The `sh + bits > 32` branch is why the uint64 was there: `32 - sh` is a
    32-bit shift by 32 when sh == 0, which is undefined. sh == 0 also means
    the field cannot straddle (bits <= 32), so that branch is unreachable
    then, and it is a Python-level `if` on compile-time constants here rather
    than a data-dependent select -- the bad shift is never emitted at all.

# PREFILL PEAK: the transient that made a 11.6 GiB model need 18.7 GiB.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT (Noah, 2026-09-03, 27B 3.9bpw, 2048-token prompt, stock
# mlx-lm): peak 18.7 G against 11.6 G active. The ~7 G is this file's
# large-N path -- above _DENSE_FUSED_MAX_N_PACKED every VQLinear leaves the
# fused kernel and materialises a decoded fp16 weight (17408 x 5120 x 2 B =
# 178 MB per mlp linear, and the packed rungs allocate an unpacked code slab
# on the way there too).
#
# WHY IT IS NOT 178 MB. mlx is LAZY: it builds the entire forward graph
# before evaluating any of it, so nothing forces layer L's decoded weight to
# be freed before layer L+1's is allocated. Across 64 layers x 3 linears the
# live set is bounded only by how far ahead the graph is built -- which is
# how 178 MB of legitimate working memory becomes ~7 G of peak.
#
# WHY PEAK IS THE BUDGET, NOT RSS. The earlier note in this file (correctly)
# said not to quote get_peak_memory() as a RAM requirement, because a single
# model in isolation completes under a much smaller cap. That still holds for
# the single-model case. It does NOT hold for Noah's use case: several models
# resident at once, where every model's peak is charged against the same
# machine at the same time. There, "space-saving model" has to mean
# peak ~= resident + KV + a small BOUNDED buffer, so this path has to have a
# fixed transient budget rather than a graph-depth-dependent one.
#
# THE FIX IS THE FORCED EVAL, NOT THE TILING -- and that distinction cost a
# wrong claim, so it is written down. The plan was to decode in OUT-row tiles
# under a byte budget, on the reasoning that splitting along OUT reorders no
# reduction: output element (n, o) is the same length-IN dot product
# whichever tile row o lands in. That reasoning is correct about the MATH and
# wrong about MLX. Measured: at 51-row tiles the output bits DIFFER from the
# untiled path (tests/test_vq_dense_peak.py caught it), because mlx's GEMM
# chooses how to split its own K reduction based on the operand SHAPE -- so
# changing the output width changes the accumulation order inside the matmul,
# even though nothing in this file reordered anything. Row tiling is
# therefore NOT bit-identical in general, and whether it happens to be at any
# given shape is luck (it holds at 64 MB on the real 27B shapes; it does not
# at 51 rows).
#
# So the DEFAULT is the part that IS provably bit-identical: decode the whole
# weight exactly as before -- one tile, one GEMM, same shapes, same bits --
# and simply mx.eval the result before returning. Forcing evaluation cannot
# change a value; it only decides WHEN the graph runs. That alone caps the
# live set at ONE layer's transient instead of the whole forward's, which is
# 13x of the 14x that was available.
#
# Row tiling stays reachable (VQ_DENSE_DECODE_TILE_MB > 0) for anyone who
# needs a harder, width-independent bound and can accept a GEMM-shape
# dependent last bit. It is OFF by default, like every other
# non-bit-identical option in this codebase.
