# Third-party source vendored here

Every module in this folder is a copy of a model implementation from
another project, taken deliberately and recorded in `PROVENANCE.md`. They
are loaded into `sys.modules` by `knurlogic.engine.register`; nothing is
written into anyone's `site-packages`.

## Licenses

| file | upstream project | license |
|---|---|---|
| `glm5_next/ (incl. _mlx_vlm/)` | mlx-vlm 0.6.17 | MIT — Copyright (c) 2025 Prince Canuma |
| `glm5_next/_mlx_vlm/models/deepseek_v4/hyper_connection.py` | mlx-vlm 0.6.17 | MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 Apple Inc. |

Some files carry no copyright header upstream; they are covered by their
project's MIT license regardless, and are listed here so the obligation is
discharged in one place.

## Staying current is the point

Vendoring pins a KNOWN version; it is not a reason to hold an old one. The
first `glm5_next` copied here came from a 0.6.17 env and upstream was already
on 0.7.1 with a file the older copy did not have at all. Re-vendor when
upstream moves, and let the smoke decide whether the new one is better.

## Replacing these

The plan is to own these implementations rather than carry copies. A file
replaced by an independent implementation should be removed from the table
above in the same commit that replaces it — leaving a stale attribution is
its own kind of wrong.
