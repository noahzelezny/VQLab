# quantlab M1d — VQ expert runtime for mlx_lm.
# Canonical copy lives in quantlab/vq_switch.py; patch_mlx_lm.py installs it
# as mlx_lm/models/vq_switch.py and hooks load_model. Keep both in sync by
# re-running the patcher, never by editing the installed copy.
#
# Format (per VQ'd expert tensor, produced by vq_*_codes fitters):
#   {p}.codes      uint8 (K<=256) / uint16   [E, out, in/d]
#   {p}.codebook   fp16                      [K, d]      (d=2, 4 or 8)
#   {p}.vq_scales  fp16                      [E, out, in/group]
#
# d=8 (E36 mixed geometry, 2026-08-15): each module dispatches on its own
# codebook shape, so a model can mix d4 and d8 tensors freely. d8 codebooks
# above 2K entries (K4096 = 64 KB fp16) cannot live in Apple's 32 KB
# threadgroup memory — the d8 kernels keep the codebook in DEVICE memory and
# rely on L2 residency (measured, not assumed: see m1b_bench d8 rows). A
# threadgroup d8 variant exists for K<=1024 (16 KB codebook).
#
# Two execution regimes (measured on M4, m1b/m1c benches, 2026-08-15):
#   decode (small N):  fused LUT-matmul kernel, threadgroup codebook + x,
#                      uchar4 code loads — 0.66-0.88x gather_qmm
#   prefill (large N): decode experts to dense fp16 chunks + ONE padded
#                      batched GEMM per chunk — 1.21-1.28x gather_qmm
#   The row-batched gather_mm path is a known trap (0.43x): do not "simplify"
#   the prefill path back to it.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE 1.21-1.28x ABOVE (VQ-PF1, 2026-08-16): that
# figure was measured with an `rng.integers` router, which pads only 1.20x.
# REAL MoE routing is skewed ~8.7x (max 1574 rows/expert vs mean 180), and
# the padded GEMM pads every expert in a chunk to that chunk's MAX row count
# — so expert-id-ordered chunking did 5.80x the necessary FLOPs and the
# prefill path measured ~9x SLOWER than gather_qmm end-to-end, not faster.
# The kernel was never at fault: at the real workload shape it is at parity
# (61.5 ms both). The fix is in `_prefill` below — chunk experts by SIMILAR
# ROW COUNT, not by expert id. Any future prefill benchmark MUST use a real
# router histogram or it will reproduce the same blind spot.

#
# 128 -> 32 is 1.37x / 1.38x / 1.37x — the knee is the SAME for K128, K256
# and K2048, so codebook size does not move it.
#
# 32 rather than 16, which is marginally faster still, because 32 is the
# smallest chunk that reproduces the published perplexity EXACTLY
# (nll 9452.9414 on 2.2bpw; 16 gives 9465.2217 and 8 gives 9450.3555).
# Those shifts are float ORDERING, not quality: `ne` is the batched-GEMM
# batch dim, a different ne picks a different Metal tiling, and fp16 sums in
# a different order — chunk 8 lands BELOW the published number and chunk 16
# above it. A lower ppl from reordering cannot be banked; it is the same
# model measured differently. So the rule is: take the knee, keep exactness.
#
# CAUTION FOR ANYONE RE-MEASURING THIS. Do NOT time it with
# score_tasks_streaming.py --selftest: that re-reads the whole model from
# disk every pass (~63 s of a ~100 s run at 100 GiB), so it is DISK-bound and
# reports "no difference" for a change worth 1.37x. That mistake was made on

# d=8, DEVICE codebook, ONE SIMDGROUP PER OUTPUT ROW (E141, 2026-09-01).
#
# WHY. _SRC_FUSED_D8 above gives each output row to ONE thread, which walks
# its NSUB codes strictly sequentially. Every code costs two DEPENDENT device
# loads (read the code, then index the 256 KB codebook with it), so the whole
# row is a chain of ~2*NSUB serialised round-trips with one load in flight.
# Measured on the 397B shapes that is 14-27 GB/s of code traffic against a
# 546 GB/s machine: latency-bound, not bandwidth-bound.
#
# FIX. The layout the DENSE kernels already use (_SRC_DENSE_D4_TILED): one
# 32-lane simdgroup per row, lane `l` owning scale group `b*32+l`. The 32
# lanes issue their code and codebook loads independently, so a row has up to
# 32 loads in flight instead of one, and the per-group partials are combined
# with a simd_shuffle reduction.
#
# BIT-EXACTNESS. The shuffle reduction walks i = 0..31 in ASCENDING group
# order and applies srow[b*32+i] in exactly the sequence _SRC_FUSED_D8's
# sequential `for g` loop does, and each lane accumulates its own group in the
# same q order with the same float4 dots — so the float op order is identical
# and the output is bit-for-bit equal (asserted in tests/test_vq_expert_simd.py).
# x is staged as float4, matching _SRC_FUSED_D8's cache, so no extra rounding
# is introduced for a non-half T either.
#
# The row guard is a PREDICATE (`active`), never an early return: the tile
# loop below contains threadgroup barriers, and a subset of a threadgroup
# returning early past a barrier is undefined behaviour.
#
# NGRP >= 32 IS REQUIRED, AND THE DISPATCHER ENFORCES IT. Lane `l` owns scale
# group `l`, so a layer with fewer than 32 groups leaves lanes idle. Measured
# per-call over N=1..10, packed and unpacked:
#
#     NGRP     shape                       M4 Max        M3 Ultra
#       64     397B gate/up (IN=4096)   2.15-2.34x      1.20-1.84x
#       16     397B down    (IN=1024)   1.02-1.62x      1.20-1.83x
#       10     F-Next down  (IN= 640)   0.94-1.03x      1.06-1.37x
#
# NGRP=64 wins on BOTH machines by a wide margin; NGRP<=16 is machine-
# dependent and at NGRP=10 the M4 loses outright. So the gate is NGRP >= 32 --
# every lane has work -- which is never slower on either box.
#
# WHY NOT SPLIT A GROUP ACROSS LANES to fill the idle lanes at NGRP<32? Because
# it cannot be made BIT-EXACT. The thread-per-row kernel sums a group's SPG
# products strictly sequentially; any lane split computes partial sums and
# recombines them, which re-associates the fp32 adds and changes the last bits.
# Every published number for these rungs was produced by the old ordering, so
# a re-association is not available to us here. NGRP<32 keeps the old kernel.

# d=2, THREADGROUP codebook, ONE SIMDGROUP PER OUTPUT ROW (E14x, 2026-09-02).
#
# MEASURED AND DELIBERATELY NOT DISPATCHED --- kept as the reference twin and
# so the negative result is not re-derived. On real 2.1bpw codes (M3 Ultra,
# 48 dispatches/eval, E=64 slice) it runs 0.80-1.09x the thread-per-row kernel:
#
#     tensor      N   NGRP   uchar us   simd us
#     gate_proj  10     40      57.8      70.7
#     gate_proj  20     40      78.3      93.8
#     up_proj    10     40      69.5      61.9
#     up_proj    20     40      69.9      84.2
#     down_proj  10     10      57.6      58.8
#
# WHY IT DOES NOT WIN, unlike its d8 twin. The layout exists to hide DEPENDENT
# DEVICE round-trips: at d=8/K=16384 the 256 KB codebook lives in device memory,
# so every code costs read-then-index against L2 and only one load is in flight
# per row. At d=2/K=256 the codebook is 1 KB and sits in THREADGROUP memory, so
# there is no device round-trip to hide, and the layout's own costs (two barriers
# per block, a 32-step shuffle reduction, 31 of 32 lanes idle at the write) are
# pure overhead. It is not occupancy either: this launches 204,800 threads
# against the old kernel's 6,400 for the same time. The d2 bottleneck was the
# WIDTH OF THE CODE LOAD, which _SRC_FUSED_D2_U32 below fixes instead (1.47-1.86x).
#
# WHY. This is the geometry the Flash-Next 2.1bpw rung actually dispatches --- its
# expert geometry is d=2 / K=256 / unpacked uint8 (codebook [256,2]), so the d4
# u8-view fast path does not apply and the D==2 branch above is taken. Until now
# d2 had NO simdgroup expert kernel at all: _SRC_FUSED_D2 gives each output row
# to ONE thread walking NSUB codes strictly sequentially. At the gate/up shape
# (OUT=640, IN=2560 -> NSUB=1280) a decode step with N=10 pairs launches only
# 6,400 threads for 8.2M dependent code reads --- latency-bound AND badly
# under-occupied on an 80-core M3 Ultra.
#
# MEASURED COST OF THE OLD LAYOUT (M3 Ultra, 2026-09-02, artifact resident,
# 377-token greedy, stub-ablation of VQSwitchLinear.__call__): the VQ expert
# path costs 9.84 ms/token against stock gather_qmm's 3.09 on the same
# architecture and prompt --- 34% of the whole 19.7 ms/token decode gap.
#
# FIX. The layout _SRC_DENSE_D2_TILED already uses, with the expert stride
# folded into crow/srow: one 32-lane simdgroup per row, lane `l` owning scale
# group `b*32+l`, per-group partials combined by simd_shuffle. 32 independent
# loads in flight per row instead of one, and 32x the threads.
#
# BIT-EXACTNESS. _SRC_FUSED_D2's sequential `for g` loop covers group g with
# subvectors j in [g*SPG, (g+1)*SPG) (its running j advances 4 per q over
# QPG = G/8 iterations, i.e. G/2 = SPG per group), accumulating the same four
# dots per q into one float gacc, then applying srow[g] by fma in ASCENDING g.
# Each lane here computes exactly that expression for its own g, and the
# shuffle loop applies srow[b*32+i] for i = 0..31 ascending --- same operands,
# same order, same rounding. x is staged as half2 exactly as the old kernel
# caches it, and cb is the same threadgroup half2 copy. So the output is
# bit-for-bit equal, not merely close (asserted in tests/test_vq_expert_simd.py).
#
# The row guard is a PREDICATE (`active`), never an early return: the tile loop
# contains threadgroup barriers and a subset of a threadgroup returning early
# past a barrier is undefined behaviour.
#
# NGRP >= 32 IS REQUIRED AND THE DISPATCHER ENFORCES IT, for the same reason as
# the d4/d8 twins: lane `l` owns group `l`, so fewer than 32 groups idles lanes.
# On this rung gate_proj/up_proj have NGRP = 2560/64 = 40 (gated in, 96 of the
# 144 expert calls) and down_proj has NGRP = 640/64 = 10 (gated out, keeps the
# thread-per-row kernel, where its 2560 rows already give decent occupancy).

# d=2, unpacked uint8 codes read FOUR AT A TIME as uint32 (E14x, 2026-09-02).
#
# WHY. _SRC_FUSED_D2 reads `crow[j]` as a uchar, one code per load. Measured on
# the shipped 2.1bpw gate_proj (real codes, E=64 slice, N=10, 48 dispatches per
# eval, M3 Ultra): 68.4 us/dispatch to move 8.7 MB of codes+scales = 128 GB/s on
# an 819 GB/s machine, i.e. 16% of peak, while stock gather_qmm at 3-bit hits
# 292 GB/s on the same shape in situ. The kernel is neither latency-bound (the
# 1 KB K=256 codebook is in threadgroup memory, so there is no dependent device
# round-trip per code, which is why the simdgroup-per-row twin above buys
# nothing here: 1.01-1.09x) nor occupancy-bound (that twin launches 32x the
# threads for the same time). It is spending its bandwidth on scalar byte loads.
#
# FIX. This is the d=2 analogue of the U8-VIEW dispatch the d4 path already
# uses: an unpacked uint8 code row is byte-for-byte a little-endian uint32 word
# stream, so the host reinterprets `codes` with mx.view (zero copy) and the
# kernel reads ONE word per four codes. The existing loop already steps four
# subvectors per q (QPG = G/8 iterations of four dots), so a q is exactly one
# word and the restructuring is mechanical.
#
# BIT-EXACTNESS. Byte i of the little-endian word is code j+i --- the same
# uint8 values the uchar loads produced --- fed to the same cb[] lookups, the
# same four dots summed in the same a+b+c+d expression, the same per-group
# float accumulator and the same ascending-group fma of srow[g]. Nothing about
# the arithmetic or its order changes; only the width of the code load does.
# Output is bit-for-bit equal (asserted in tests/test_vq_expert_simd.py against

# SIMD_SUM REDUCTION twin of _SRC_FUSED_PACKED_D8_SIMD (2026-09-02, arc 4).
# OFF BY DEFAULT: it is NOT bit-identical, and this arc's gate is bit-identity.
#
# WHAT IT CHANGES. Only the per-block reduction. The shipped kernel finishes
# each 32-group block with 32 SEQUENTIALLY DEPENDENT steps
#     acc = fma(srow[b*32+i], simd_shuffle(gacc, i), acc)
# so every lane redundantly walks a 32-long fp32 dependency chain and issues 32
# scale loads, against only SPG = G/8 = 8 iterations of actual code work. This
# variant has each lane hold its own group's scale and calls simd_sum once.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Arc 4 ablated the kernel instruction by instruction (cost-only
# arms, each WRONG on purpose, each a lower bound), real L20 tensors, E=64,
# rows=8, min/median over 15 interleaved reps x 50 dispatches:
#
#     arm (N=10 / N=20, fraction of base)      gate      up
#       inner code loop deleted             0.57/0.52  0.57/0.52
#       reduction deleted                   0.86/0.82  0.84/0.81
#       reduction's scale loads deleted     0.91/0.88  0.91/0.88
#       reduction chain broken into 4 ILP   0.91/0.90  0.92/0.90
#       simd_sum (this variant)             0.87/0.84  0.85/0.84
#
# i.e. the reduction owns ~19% of the dispatch and simd_sum recovers ~16 of
# those 19 points -- it lands essentially ON the "reduction is free" floor.
# The chain is LATENCY, not shuffle throughput: breaking it into 4 independent
# partials recovers most of the same ground.
#
# This also explains an asymmetry arc 2 recorded but did not attribute: the
# NGRP=10 down_proj, which is DECLINED from this simd layout and runs
# thread-per-row with NO reduction, was the FASTEST shape per code byte
# (95.8 GB/s vs gate's 71.8). The layout it is excluded from is the layout
# carrying the reduction tax.
#
# WHY IT IS OFF. simd_sum re-associates the sum into a tree and un-fuses the
# scale multiply, so the last mantissa bit can move. Measured on real tensors:
# 0.05-0.16% of output elements differ, every one of them by ONE half-ULP.
# Against an independent fp32 mlx reference the two are a TIE -- identical max
# error to every printed digit, identical mean error, and which one is closer
# flips between shapes. So this is a last-place-bit tie, not a loss of
# accuracy. It still is not bit-identity, and bit-identity is the gate, so
# turning it on is a POLICY decision (relax the gate to 1-ULP equivalence plus
# a ppl/KL re-referee and an end-to-end A/B) that this arc does not take
# unilaterally. VQ_D8_SIMDSUM=1 dispatches it so the finding stays reproducible.
#
# Untouched by construction: the d2/K256 layers 0-1 never reach this kernel,
# and the NGRP=10 down_proj is declined from the simd layout by the NGRP>=32
# gate, so neither can regress.

# WHY IT WINS (scripts/bench_d8_stage.py, real L20 tensors, E=64, arc-standard
# interleaved min/med): the cost split of the ~36% arc 4 left unprobed is
#     staging deleted  0.52 of base   barriers deleted  0.98   empty  0.15
# i.e. the BARRIERS are ~2% and the STAGING is nearly half the dispatch. The
# tile was built to save device reads of x, but at rows=8 every threadgroup
# re-stages the whole row (OUT/8 = 80 threadgroups re-read 5 KiB per token
# row), and the threadgroup store+load round-trip plus the barrier convoy
# costs far more than L1-served device reads of the same bytes. Reading x
# directly measures 0.81-0.84 of base at N=10/20 on both gate and up
# (1.19-1.23x), 0.95-1.02 at the launch-bound N=1, and composes with nothing
# it invalidates: the reduction, code fetch and scale walk are untouched.
#
# VQ_D8_DEVX=0 restores the staged kernel for A/B without a rebuild. The
# simd_sum twin above still derives from the STAGED base so the arc 4
# negative stays reproducible bit-for-bit; a devx+simd_sum combination is a
# one-line replace if the bit-identity gate is ever relaxed.

# REGISTER-BUFFERED twin of _SRC_FUSED_PACKED_D8_SIMD (2026-09-02).
#
# The kernel above is LOAD-ISSUE bound, not bandwidth bound: it moves 61-97
# GB/s of the M3 Ultra's 819, and the profiling arc that measured it REFUTED
# both codebook residency (shrinking the hot set 256 KiB -> 4 KiB buys 8%)
# and load width. What is left is issue: ~4 device loads per code against one
# load issued per core per cycle, and 1-2 of those four are the VQ_CODE
# bit-field read, which re-reads the SAME uint32 word for every code that
# lands in it.
#
# _SRC_DENSE_PACKED_D2 already fixes this for d=2 (82 us vs 169 on a
# comparable dependent chain) by copying a lane's code words into registers
# once. It does not port mechanically, and that is the whole difficulty: at
# d=2/G=64 a lane's group is EXACTLY one 32-code block, so its words start at
# bit 0 of the block and every extraction offset is compile-time. At d=8 a
# lane owns only SPG = G/8 codes, so NPH = 32/SPG lanes share a block and
# lane p starts at bit p*SPG*BITS INTO it -- a runtime offset, and indexing a
# register array with a runtime index SPILLS TO MEMORY on Apple GPUs, which
# is strictly worse than the device reads it replaces.
#
# The obvious fix -- an if/else chain over the NPH phases with each body
# compile-time specialised -- was BUILT AND MEASURED FIRST, and it is 1.9x
# SLOWER (see the ledger, 2026-09-02). The reason is structural and is the
# thing that makes d=8 hard: the phase p = g & (NPH-1) varies WITHIN a
# simdgroup (lane L owns group b*32+L, so consecutive lanes have consecutive
# phases), so all NPH bodies are executed serially by the whole simdgroup.
# Compile-time specialisation on a per-lane-varying value buys specialisation
# and pays NPH-way divergence. Regrouping lanes by phase does not help --
# divergence on Apple GPUs is per-simdgroup, and every branch still has an
# active lane.
#
# So the phase is handled BRANCHLESSLY instead. Each lane loads the SAME
# constexpr NW words from a runtime word offset (pointer arithmetic, not
# register indexing, so no spill and no divergence), then FUNNEL-SHIFTS that
# window down by the runtime bit offset SH0:
#
#     v[i] = (wb[i] >> SH0) | (wb[i+1] << (32 - SH0))
#
# after which every code sits at bit q*BITS from v[0] and every v[] index and
# shift in the extraction is a literal, exactly as in the d=2 kernel. The
# funnel is a uniform-cost select, identical work on every lane.
#
# Word footprint per lane, at the shipped SPG=8/BITS=14: a lane's 8 codes are
# 112 bits starting at p*112 within the block's 14 words, so p in {0,1,2,3}
# starts at word {0,3,7,10} bit {0,16,0,16}, and NW = 4 words covers the
# widest case (16 + 112 = 128 bits) -- 4 loads per 8 codes where VQ_CODE
# issued ~12. The window NEVER leaves the block: the largest read is
# blk[10+3] = blk[13] = blk[BITS-1]. _d8_regbuf_ok asserts that in Python
# rather than trusting it.
#
# BIT-EXACTNESS. Extraction order, the two dots per code, the per-lane gacc,
# and the ascending-group simd_shuffle scale reduction are copied verbatim
# from the kernel above; only WHERE the code words are read from changes.
# Output is bit-identical by construction and asserted as such against
# _SRC_FUSED_PACKED_D8_SIMD (tests/test_vq_expert_simd.py).

# --- NSUB-TILED dense d2 twins ---------------------------------------------
# The kernels above stage the WHOLE x row in threadgroup memory
# (`xs[MAX_NSUB]`), so their allocation is (K + NSUB) * 4 + overhead and grows
# with LAYER WIDTH. At the 27B mlp shapes (IN 17408 -> NSUB 8704) that is
# 34,816 bytes for xs alone against Metal's 32,768 cap, so the kernel fails at
# LOAD and VQLinear falls back to decoding the entire weight per call --- the
# path that measured 0.43 tok/s against stock's 16.7 (docs/DENSE-VQ-DECODE.md).
#
# The fix is free, because the existing block loop already IS the tile. Lane
# `lane` of block `b` owns scale-group g = b*32 + lane and touches exactly
# xs[g*SPG .. g*SPG+SPG). Across the 32 lanes of one block that is a
# CONTIGUOUS span of 32*SPG sub-vectors, so staging just that span is enough:
#
#     allocation = (K + 32*SPG) * 4 + overhead        <- no NSUB term at all
#
# For G=64 that is 1024 half2 = 4 KB of x regardless of how wide the layer is;
# with K=4096 the whole thing is 20 KB. Total device traffic is unchanged ---
# each x element is still read once per threadgroup, just later.
#
# BIT-EXACTNESS. Every arithmetic operation, its operands and its order are
# untouched: the same half conversion, the same four-way dot per q, the same
# per-lane gacc, the same simd_shuffle reduction applying srow[] in ascending
# group order. Only the storage location of xs changes. So these kernels are
# bit-identical to the untiled twins by construction, and that is asserted
# against them on every shape where both can run.
#
# BARRIER DISCIPLINE. The untiled kernels early-return on `r >= OUT` before
# the loop. That is illegal once barriers live INSIDE the loop --- a
# threadgroup barrier must be reached by every thread --- so the tiled twins
# carry the row guard as a predicate (`active`) and let inactive threads run
# the loop for its barriers only. Inactive rows shuffle garbage among
# themselves (one row == one simdgroup, since threadgroup.x is 32) and never
# write y.

# --- dense d4, tiled x + DEVICE codebook -----------------------------------
# The 3.9bpw 27B rung is d=4/K=4096 and had no dense kernel of any kind, so
# every one of its 192 VQ linears decoded its whole weight per forward:
# 0.426 tok/s against stock's 16.687 (docs/DENSE-VQ-DECODE.md). Tiling alone
# does not rescue it, because at d=4 the CODEBOOK is the thing that does not
# fit --- K=4096 float4 entries is 65,536 bytes, twice the whole 32 KB
# threadgroup budget, before x is considered at all.
#
# So this kernel takes the same route _SRC_FUSED_D8 already takes for the same
# reason: leave the codebook in DEVICE memory and let L2 hold it (64 KB of
# fp16 is comfortably L2-resident, and every lane in the threadgroup reads the
# same table). Only x is staged, and it is tiled, so the threadgroup
# allocation is 32*SPG*8 bytes --- 4 KB at G=64 --- independent of BOTH K and
# layer width.
#
# Arithmetic mirrors _SRC_FUSED (the d4 expert kernel) exactly: float4 dots,
# four codes unrolled per step, one float accumulator per scale group, scales
# applied in ascending group order. The group-parallel simd_shuffle reduction
# is the dense d2 layout, which applies srow[] in the same ascending order as

#     dispatch covers the whole [17408, 5120] layer and costs 200-4200 us
#     against an expert dispatch's 13-67, so there is nothing to win by
#     dispatching less often. The "fewer dispatches" lever does not exist on
#     this side of the house.
#
# WHAT THE TWINS CHANGE. Only where x is read from: the threadgroup tile, the
# staging loop and (where legal) the barriers are deleted, and each lane reads
# its own x slice from device as vec<T,2> / vec<T,4>.
#
# BIT-IDENTITY. The staging loop narrowed T to half on the way in
# (`xs[i] = half2((half)xrow[..], ..)`), so the twins narrow the same way with
# an explicit `half2(...)` / `half4(...)` cast around the device read rather
# than a bare `float2(xr2[m])`. That distinction is load-bearing: a bare widen
# would be identical only for T=half and would silently skip the narrowing for
# a bf16 or fp32 activation. With the cast the values entering every dot --
# and the dot/fma order, the code fetch, the scale walk and the reduction --
# are exactly the base kernel's, so these are bit-identical for EVERY T by
# construction, asserted on real tensors before any timing was printed
# (scripts/bench_dense_stage.py) and pinned by tests/test_vq_dense_devx.py.
#
# BARRIER DISCIPLINE, and why the d2 twins keep one. The d4 kernels hold their
# codebook in DEVICE memory, so once x staging is gone they need no barrier at
# all. The d2 kernels stage the CODEBOOK into threadgroup memory
# (`cb[MAX_K]`), and today the barrier that publishes it is the first one
# inside the block loop. Deleting every barrier there would leave the codebook
# fill unsynchronised -- a data race that would read garbage codebook entries,
# not a slower kernel. So the d2 twins keep exactly ONE barrier, hoisted out
# of the loop, immediately after the codebook fill.

# --- dense simd_sum twins: OFF BY DEFAULT, and they must stay that way -----
# The dense reduction text is character-identical to the packed-d8 one, so
# arc 4's simd_sum rewrite applies verbatim: instead of a 32-step serial
# `acc = fma(srow[i], simd_shuffle(gacc, i), acc)` chain, each lane scales its
# own group partial and one simd_sum reduces the 32 of them in tree order.
#
# IT IS FAST. Composed on devx, per dispatch: 2.01-2.10x vs the staged base,
# i.e. a further 1.19-1.22x on top of devx alone (gate N=20 2451 -> 2004 us).
# The ablation says why -- the reduction is ~33% of a dense dispatch (nored
# 0.66-0.69), against ~19% in the expert kernel.
#
# IT IS NOT COVERED BY THE 1-ULP DECISION, AND IT IS NOT MINE TO TURN ON.
# The 2026-09-02 gate relaxation (f6aa628) is explicitly "for this reduction
# only", meaning the packed-d8 expert kernel, where the measured divergence
# was ~0.1% of elements at ONE HALF-ULP. The dense divergence is an order of
# magnitude larger: measured max 1.00 / 4.00 / 2.00 / 7.00 ULP (gate, N=1/5/
# 10/20) and up to 8.00 ULP on down_proj. Two structural reasons -- a dense
# row reduces over NGRP=80-272 groups spread across NBLK=3-9 blocks, so the
# tree/serial disagreement compounds per block instead of once; and there is
# no expert axis to average it away.
#
# So this is NOT a 1-ULP change and the existing decision does not reach it:
# turning it on would need its own referee pass, on the dense line, at dense
# ULP. That is Noah's call, not this arc's. Shipped OFF, behind

# gather + broadcast-scale — three full materialisations — with one kernel
# whose only buffer is the [rows, IN] fp16 output. The GEMM downstream is
# untouched: same w shape/dtype/strides, so mlx picks the same tiling and
# bits cannot move there (the row-tiling lesson).
#
# Bit-exactness is structural: every w[r, e] is an independent
# (half)(float(s) * float(cb)) — no reduction, no ordering. The exact product
# of two fp16 significands fits fp32, so the float path applies exactly one
# RTNE rounding, same as mlx's half*half elementwise op. That one assumption
# is the ship gate: tests/test_vq_wdec.py compares uint16 BIT PATTERNS (not
# array_equal — NaN != NaN) against _decode(_unpack_rows(...)).
#
# Codebook stays in DEVICE memory — zero threadgroup allocation, so the E134
# "Threadgroup memory size exceeds" load-failure class is structurally
# impossible and wdec_fits has no cap term. (A threadgroup-cached variant was
# considered and rejected: a write kernel reads each codebook vector once per
# code with no intra-threadgroup reuse to pay for the barrier, and
# K4096*d4*2 B is exactly the 32 KB cap anyway.)
